Have you ever worked with 2D boundary shape representations and noticed that the same shape can be represented with reasonable accuracy by a much smaller number of points? Did you ever need to reduce the complexity of a 2D shape while retaining as many salient features as possible? If so then `DecimatePoly.m` is the function you have been looking for.

## Quick Demos
`DecimatePoly_demo1`: Simplify a 2D contour extracted from a binary image. Three binary images are included as examples. This demo requires [Image Processing Toolbox] to run.

`DecimatePoly_demo2`: Simplifying complex shapes while retaining geometrically and visually salient features.

`DecimatePoly_demo3`: Use `DecimatePoly.m` to improve the run-time of in-polygon tests at the cost of minor misclassification errors.
